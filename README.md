# **RasterViz standalone**

> 💡 **Background:** This application is developed as a direct evolution and standalone port of the **RasterViz QGIS Python Plugin**. While the original plugin required users to have QGIS installed, this Standalone Edition frees the user from any heavy GIS software dependencies, packing powerful spatial visualization tools into a fast, dedicated desktop environment.

## 🚀 How to Run from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Defani/RasterViz.git](https://github.com/Defani/RasterViz.git)
   cd RasterViz

```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv build_venv
# Windows
build_venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source build_venv/bin/activate

```


3. **Install the dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


4. **Run the application:**
```bash
cd app
python main.py

```

## 📦 Compiling into a Permanent App (.exe)

You can compile RasterViz into a permanent, standalone Windows executable using **PyInstaller**. This allows you to run the application on any computer without needing to install Python or the required libraries.

1. Ensure you have PyInstaller and the necessary hooks installed in your environment:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller pyinstaller-hooks-contrib

```


2. Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:
```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --name="RasterViz" --windowed --icon="app/icon.png" --add-data="app/icon.png;." app/main.py

```


*Note: Because geospatial libraries (like `rasterio`, `fiona`, and `pyproj`) require extensive underlying C-libraries and PROJ data dictionaries, compiling them might require specific `.spec` file modifications to ensure all coordinate system data is bundled correctly.*
3. Once compiled, your executable will be located in the newly created `dist/RasterViz` folder. You can create a shortcut of `RasterViz.exe` to your desktop!
